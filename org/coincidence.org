Do you trust [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence][coincidences]]? Do you think they exist or do you belong to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory][conspiracy party]]?

Personally, I think that a coincidence is how we call an event we can hardly explain, because we miss the whole picture. In other words, if we don't know the causes, effects are coincidences. I'm [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29][not the only one]] to think that, as defined in the common sense (purely random events, weird enough to be noted), coincidences don't exist. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlewood%27s_law][Others]] give [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Truly_Large_Numbers][strong arguments]] supporting this opinion, explaining the law we sometimes miss.

I'm not sure the law is correct (is it a coincidence, too?) but, fearing to fall into the deplorable condition in which you are not even sure of existing, I'm sure a law exist. I have to, otherwise I'd better stop thinking: "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum][cogito ergo sum]]" or "[[http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/discover_skepticism.html][sum ergo cogito]]"? This thinking is not a coincidence, you bet.

Today is the day after the [[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/04/dirette/sezioni/politica/elezioni/elezionimar/index.html][political election]] in my country (Italy). I will not discuss about results: trust me, we have discussed enough.

Today is also the day [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Provenzano][Bernardo Provenzano]] has been [[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/04/dirette/sezioni/cronaca/provenzano/provenzano/index.html][arrested]]. He has been fugitive for 42 years: I mean... [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28number%29][42]]!!! Isn't it the number of months the beast will hold possession over the world? Or the Tao Te Ching's chapter where universe is explained? Or, more simply, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything][the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything]]? Is it a coincidence? Are mafia and politics always incidentally linked?

Well, I think it's at least /weird/ the choice of the day for his arrest: it must have been longly planned... I'll think about it, will you?
