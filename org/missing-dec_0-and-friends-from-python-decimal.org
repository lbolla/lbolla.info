#+TITLE: Missing =Dec_0= and friends from Python Decimal

#+DATE: <2010-07-29>

This fails in =py2.4=, =py2.5.1= and =py2.6=:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    from decimal import Dec_0
#+END_SRC

But it works in all the other =py2.5= subversions!

It seems that exposing =Dec_0= (and other similar constants) was considered a [[http://bugs.python.org/issue4812][bug]] and "fixed" on Jan 3rd 2009 by renaming it =_Dec_0=.

Indeed, if I had looked at the source code, I would have seen that =Dec_0= was for "internal use only".

From =/usr/lib/python2.5/decimal.py:5159=

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    ##### Useful Constants (internal use only) ################################

    # Reusable defaults
    Inf = Decimal('Inf')
    negInf = Decimal('-Inf')
    NaN = Decimal('NaN')
    Dec_0 = Decimal(0)
    Dec_p1 = Decimal(1)
    Dec_n1 = Decimal(-1)
#+END_SRC

Those definitions are missing in =py2.4= and =py2.5.1=, and renamed in =py2.6=.

Damn: never use undocumented features!
