#+TITLE: Installing Ubuntu 6.06 on Dell Inspiron 5150

#+DATE: <2006-06-05>

I decided to switch to Ubuntu, at last. And I'm definitely happy for the choice: smooth looking feel, decent speed and big selection of applications.

Just one "down" point: I spent a whole weekend to install it! Not bad, for a distribution said to be "easy on"... After an afternoon reading [[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=140&order=desc][here]], not finding any useful suggestion for my case, I found the solution.

For me (and my Dell Inspiron 5150) the alternate cd worked. So, just forget the install/live cd and go for the alternate: there are no differences, a part from the fact that you'll have to forget the graphical istaller. hth.
