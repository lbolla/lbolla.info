#+TITLE: twill revived

#+DATE: <2011-03-11>

After reading [[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://adam.therobots.org/talks/testing.pdf][how to do automated testing in python]], I've started using [[http://twill.idyll.org/][twill]], by [[mailto:titus@idyll.org][C. Titus Brown]]

  twill is a simple language that allows users to browse the Web from a command-line interface. With twill, you can navigate through Web sites that use forms, cookies, and most standard Web features.

Unfortunately, development on twill seems to have stopped 3 years ago.

I've [[http://github.com/lbolla/twill][cloned the project on Github]], fixed some deprecation warnings and added a cool new feature to inspect headers, as well as html.

Testing is more interesting than I thought.
