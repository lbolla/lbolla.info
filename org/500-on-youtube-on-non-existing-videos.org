#+TITLE: 500 on YouTube on non-existing videos

#+DATE: <2011-12-17>

Now, [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtf][this is embarassing...]] It looks like requesting a non-existent video on YouTube causes a "500 Internal Server Error"!

For example:

-  Valid url: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5CeNunbHto]]
-  Invalid url: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtf]]

Surely, a better response would be something like the one returned when the =videoId= is missing: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=]]. It seems like [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxXc_fXxMoE][predictions became true]].
