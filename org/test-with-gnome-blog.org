#+TITLE: Test with gnome-blog

#+DATE: <2009-02-03>

This is a post using [[http://www.gnome.org/~seth/gnome-blog/][gnome-blog]], a weblog client for gnome. [[http://codex.wordpress.org/Weblog_Client][Here]] I read about this possibility, but there were no instructions about how to configure the client...

If this is published, it can't be so difficult...
