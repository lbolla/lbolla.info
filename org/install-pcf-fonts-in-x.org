#+TITLE: Installing pcf fonts in X

#+DATE: <2010-01-07>

As I keep forgetting, here is how to install =pcf= fonts in X

1. Create a new directory for the fonts, usually under /usr/share/fonts:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$> mkdir /usr/share/fonts/
#+END_SRC

2. Copy the =pcf= file(s) into it (sometimes the =pcf= files are gzipped):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$> cp /path/to/pcf/*.pcf* /usr/share/fonts/
#+END_SRC

3. Run mkfontdir, to create a fonts.dir file, used by X to find font files

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$> mkfontdir /usr/share/fonts/
#+END_SRC

4. Add the new dir to X font path. The easiest way to do it is to stick this line in your =.xinitrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xset fp+ /usr/share/fonts/
#+END_SRC

Now your new font should compare in =xfontsel= and you should be able to use it as normal.

By the way, [[http://www.proggyfonts.com/][this]] is a very nice font for programming!
