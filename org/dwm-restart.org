#+TITLE: dwm restart

#+DATE: <2010-01-08>

[[http://dwm.suckless.org/][=dwm=]] is a wonderful window manager for X: it's small, fast and stable.

The only thing I missed, until today, was the possibility to restart it without losing my X session (i.e. all the open windows, etc.). Restarting =dwm= is something you might need to do often, as it does not have config files: changes are done by recompiling the sources.

The trick is to execute =dwm= in background and sleep forever! Take a look at the last two lines of my =.xinitrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dwm & sleeper
#+END_SRC

where =sleeper= looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh
while `/bin/true`; do
    sleep 1000
done
#+END_SRC

Now, if you kill =dwm= (usually with =ALT-SHIFT-q=) the windows (and X) will still be alive and you can type =dwm&= in any xterm to get =dwm= up and running again. If you really want to quit X, you need to kill the sleeper.
