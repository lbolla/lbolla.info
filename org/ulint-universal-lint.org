#+TITLE: ulint, Universal Lint

#+DATE: <2012-01-05>

I've been using so many code static checkers lately, that I decided to write a wrapper around the ones I use the most. I called it:Â [[https://github.com/lbolla/ulint][Universal Lint]], [[https://github.com/lbolla/ulint][ulint]] for short.

At the moment, Python, Javascript and Haskell files are supported, but adding new linters/extension is trivial.

Download it and use it!
