#+TITLE: gio in cronjob
#+DATE: <2020-12-14 Mon>

[[https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gio.html][gio]] provides a nice API to deal with VFS. I am using it to mount a NAS
harddrive to use for backups.

The problem is that using it from cronjobs is not straightfoward. I got the
following errors when trying to run =gio info= and =gio mount= from a cronjob:

#+begin_example
gio: smb://internetbox-nas.local/philips%20ufd/: Operation not supported
gio: smb://internetbox-nas.local/philips%20ufd/: volume doesnâ€™t implement mount
#+end_example

I didn't find the right answer in Google, so I am sharing it here in case
someone else is affected.

The culprit is that cronjobs run in a very limited environment, and =gio=
requires some environmental variables to be set. So, just add these to your
cronjob:

#+begin_example
XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share/ubuntu:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/var/lib/snapd/desktop
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus
#+end_example

Adapt the =user_id= to fit your needs, =id -u= may be helpful, too.
