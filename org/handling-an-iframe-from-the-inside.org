#+TITLE: Handling an iframe from the inside

#+DATE: <2011-03-30>

If you've ever worked with =iframes= you've certainly run into the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy][same origin policy]].

From [[http://www.onlineaspect.com/2010/01/15/backwards-compatible-postmessage/][here]]:

  The same origin policy basically limits how scripts and frames on different domains can talk to each other.

This is particularly bad if you want to resize an =iframe= to accomodate its content, as this is not doable with simple CSS (to the best of my knowledge!). It can be done using [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage][=window.postMessage=]], though.

[[/junk/iframe/][See a demo here]].

Basically, the content of the =iframe= fires =postMessage=s to its parent window and the window itself, i.e. the =iframe= container, handles them. Cool...
