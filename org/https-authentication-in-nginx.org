#+TITLE: HTTPS authentication in nginx

#+DATE: <2012-02-20>

In order not to forget again how to setup [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication][http authentication]] in [[http://nginx.org/][nginx]] here is a reminder.

For =HTTPS= follow [[http://dracoblue.net/dev/https-nginx-with-self-signed-ssl-certificate/188/][these steps]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    $ sudo -s
    # cd /etc/nginx
    # openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
#+END_SRC

and add these lines to your =server= instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC nginx
    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl                  on;
        ssl_certificate      /etc/nginx/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  /etc/nginx/server.key;
    ...
#+END_SRC

To setup basic authentication, add these lines to the same file:

#+BEGIN_SRC nginx
    location / {
        auth_basic "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/htpasswd;
        # you might also want to deny access based on IP here
        #allow <ip-address>;
        #deny all;
    ...
#+END_SRC

Finally, to generate =/etc/nginx/htpasswd=, use this one-liner:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    echo -e "your-username:`perl -le 'print crypt("your-password","salt")'`" > /etc/nginx/htpasswd
#+END_SRC

Restart =nginx= and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob's_your_uncle][Bob's your uncle]]!
