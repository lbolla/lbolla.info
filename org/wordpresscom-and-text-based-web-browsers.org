#+TITLE: wordpress.com and text based web browsers

#+DATE: <2009-01-31>

Today, I was appreciating how well wordpress.com renders on text based web browsers (using [[http://elinks.or.cz/][elinks]]). Unfortunately, even if reading posts looks great, posting does not. Actually, I've been able to delete one of my posts, while searching to edit it. Completely wiped out.

Luckily, [[http://www.googleguide.com/cached_pages.html][google cache]] saved my time and promptly found an older copy. Beware!
