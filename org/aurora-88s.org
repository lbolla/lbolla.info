This is an =Aurora 88s= fountain pen. It was a present of my grand-grand-grandmother to my father, about 50 years ago. Now, my grandmother has given it to me. Amazingly, it still works smoothly. I wonder what of all the things I've bought in the last year will last for 50 years. Probably nothing. I will take care of it and I will use it wisely. Thank you.
