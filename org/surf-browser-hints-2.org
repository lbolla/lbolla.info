#+TITLE: surf browser hints /2

#+DATE: <2009-08-25>

Following [[./surf-browser-hints.org][yesterday's post]], here is another useful hint about surf's usage.

The following script lists the available bookmarks (from =~/.bookmarks= file) and let's you pick one using =dmenu=. If a new link is inserted, it is added to the list of known bookmarks, so you won't need to type it in full the next time:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/bin/sh
bookmarks=~/.bookmarks
link=`cat $bookmarks | dmenu ${1+"$@"}` || exit 0
present=`grep $link $bookmarks`
if [ "$?" -ne "0" ]; then
    echo $link >> $bookmarks
fi
surf -u $link
#+END_SRC

If you don't want to open a new window, just change the last line to set the =_SURF_URL= X Property of the surf window you want to use (by clicking on it):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xprop -f _SURF_URL 8t -set _SURF_URL $link `
#+END_SRC
