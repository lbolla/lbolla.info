#+TITLE: Docker, vpn and =/etc/resolv.conf=
#+DATE: <2018-06-22>

Today I encounter a strange issue with =/etc/resolv.conf=, while
working with Docker on my company's VPN.

When =openconnect= sets up the VPN, it modifies =/etc/resolv.conf=, as
expected. The funny thing is that if I now ran =docker run
<something>=, =docker= would change =/etc/resolv.conf= back to its
original value; it wouldn't even restore the "vpn" version upon exit.

After much head scratching, I figured that *maybe*, the problem was
that =openconnect= and =docker= were messing with different network
interfaces, therefore conflicting when writing their version of
=/etc/resolv.conf=.

I installed [[https://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv][resolvconf]], which is able to manage exactly this
scenario and, boom!, it's fixed! I couldn't find an answer in Google,
so I am posting my solution here, in case somebody has the same issue.
