First road trip by motorbike, this weekend: from Milan to Verona and back. You can see the photos [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lbolla/sets/72057594134326503/][here]]: one shot every 10 km, whatever there was... (taken by my new camera! Lot's of news since the last time!)

Motorbiking is relaxing and relaxing makes me think. So, while driving back home, I realized that there is a fundamental difference between motorcyclists and "car's drivers": Solidarity. If a motorcyclist has a problem other motorcyclists stop to help him, if he is OK others keep greeting him. Can you imagine that with "car's drivers"? In Italy??
