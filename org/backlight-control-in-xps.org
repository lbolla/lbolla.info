#+TITLE: Backlight control on XPS
#+DATE: <2020-12-09>

This post is more of a reminder for myself on how I fixed an issue with
[[https://www.dell.com/de-ch/shop/notebooks/xps-15/spd/xps-15-7590-laptop/][Dell XPS 15]].

The issue is that the =Fn= key to control screen brightness (using =F11= and
=F12=) doesn't work and results in this error in the logs:

The error has been reported [[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97883][many]] [[https://www.dell.com/community/Precision-Mobile-Workstations/ACPI-errors-with-new-bios-in-Dell-Precision-7540/td-p/7390895][times]] in the last year.

The only thing that worked for me was using this: [[https://github.com/udifuchs/icc-brightness][icc-brightness]]. It is
basically a workaround the BIOS/Kernel issue, but it works very well.
