#+TITLE: Tornado Redis chat

#+DATE: <2013-12-02>

[[http://redis.io/][redis]] is often described as an "in-memory persistent key-value store", but [[http://openmymind.net/2012/1/23/The-Little-Redis-Book/][it's much more than that]]. One of its nicest features is its support for the [[http://redis.io/topics/pubsub][=Publish/Subscribe messaging paradigm=]], which makes it easy to implement, for example, a chat server.

In order to learn how to use it, I decided to implement a chat server using Redis and Tornado. This is a classical exercise, and [[https://gist.github.com/pelletier/532067][others]] have done the same: but their solution has some pitfalls that I tried to fix.

The code is forked from [[https://gist.github.com/pelletier/532067][pelletier]]'s, with some improvements:

-  Support for the latest Python Redis's client [[http://redis-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][redis-py]] version 2.6.9
-  Thread-safety: using the only method in Tornado's IOLoop that is [[http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/ioloop.html?highlight=add_callback#tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.add_callback][thread-safe]]
-  Tested with Python 3.3

This is the code, available also on [[https://gist.github.com/lbolla/4754600][gist]]:
