#+TITLE: EMpy 1.0 is out! Python3 compatible!

#+DATE: <2015-04-26>

After a long sleep, I resumed development on [[http://lbolla.github.io/EMpy/][EMpy]]. The trigger was an appeal from Guido van Rossum at PyCon 2015 to package authors to support Python 3.

There are no new features to EMpy, but I have:

-  ported the code to Python 3, using the amazing [[http://python-future.org/][future]] library: now, both Python 2 and 3 are supported;
-  setup [[https://travis-ci.org/lbolla/EMpy][Travis CI]] to run unittest on all supported Python versions;
-  upgraded the dependencies to the latest available libraries;
-  Pylint'd and pep8'd the code
-  Renamed the package in PyPi to =ElectroMagneticPython= to avoid name conflicts with [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/EmPy][EmPy]].

You can try it out by simply:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $> pip install ElectroMagneticPython
#+END_SRC

There is still to be done, to make EMpy "production ready", like improving unittest coverage and documentation. If anyone is interested to contribute, get in touch!
