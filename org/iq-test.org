#+TITLE: IQ test

#+DATE: <2008-02-02>

Qualche giorno fa, mi sono imbattuto in questo [[http://www.ecmselection.co.uk/high_iq_enter_and_win/brainbuster_no_25_-_remove_digits.html][test di intelligenza]], proposto da [[http://www.ecmselection.co.uk/][ECM]]. Riporto il testo, per semplicita':

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Using each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 only once, form a nine digit number A that can satisfy the following criteria:

  -  A is exactly divisible by 9.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from A forms an eight digit number B that is exactly divisible by 8.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from B forms a seven digit number C that is exactly divisible by 7.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from C forms a six digit number D that is exactly divisible by 6.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from D forms a five digit number E that is exactly divisible by 5.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from E forms a four digit number F that is exactly divisible by 4.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from F forms a three digit number G that is exactly divisible by 3.

  -  Removing the rightmost digit from G forms a two digit number H that is exactly divisible by 2.

  What is A?

  Show how you produced B, C, D, E, F, G & H.

Dopo un po', mi sono stufato, e ho prodotto questo.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def all_perms(str):
        if len(str) <=1:
            yield str
        else:
            for perm in all_perms(str[1:]):
                for i in range(len(perm)+1):
                    yield perm[:i] + str[0:1] + perm[i:]

    def list2num(p):
        y = 0
        d = len(p)
        for ip,pp in enumerate(p):
            y += 10**(d-ip-1) * pp
        return y

    def check(p):
        for i in xrange(1,len(p)-1):
            if list2num(p[:-i]) % (9-i) != 0:
                return False
        return True

    for p in all_perms(range(1,10)):
        if check(p):
            print p
            break

Run it in python, of course!
