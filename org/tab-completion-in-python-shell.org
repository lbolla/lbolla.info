#+TITLE: Tab completion in Python shell

#+DATE: <2008-06-25>

Recently [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/b1f19db3f69cd8ce#][I saw with this little piece of code]] to give the standard python shell tab completion capabilities:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    # setup tab completion in python shell
    import rlcompleter
    import readline
    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
#+END_SRC

Obviously, you can use the environmental variable =PYTHONSTART= to execute this few lines anytime you start your python shell.

Enjoy!
