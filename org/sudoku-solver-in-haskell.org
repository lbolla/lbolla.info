#+TITLE: Sudoku solver in Haskell

#+DATE: <2012-02-27>

Recently, I've been challenged to write a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku][Sudoku]] solver. Not knowing the rules and with only 30 minutes, I needed some help...

So, in case someone asks me again, I've implemented the same algorithm in Haskell.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1925630.js"> </script>
#+END_EXPORT

I know that [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Sudoku][there are already a lot of other solutions]], but, hey, it was fun!
