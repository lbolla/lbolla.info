#+TITLE: tdaemon for Python3

#+DATE: <2011-02-20>

[[https://github.com/brunobord/tdaemon][tdaemon]] is a neat little utility to do [[http://weblog.patrice.ch/2009/02/07/continuous-testing-with-python.html][continuous testing]] in Python. Unfortunately, the original version only works with Python2. I've spent a little time toÂ [[https://github.com/lbolla/tdaemon][make it work with Python3]].

Enjoy!
