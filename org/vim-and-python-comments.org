#+TITLE: vim and Python comments

#+DATE: <2009-08-12>

I'm currently undergoing a profound revision (read "cleanup") of my =.vimrc= and I recently had to choose a decent plug-in to comment python code.

The best so far is [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=23http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=23][EnhancedCommentify]]. It's highly configurable, powerful and it supports a different number of languages (not only python).

The only one thing that wasn't easy to setup if the behaviour described [[http://chistera.yi.org/~adeodato/blog/entries/2008/03/02/vim_enhanced_commentify_UseBlockIndent_with_nmap.html][here]]: being able to comment a block, respecting the indent, in both visual and normal mode.

A clean solution, without the need to define any function is to stick these lines into your =.vimrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC vim
    let g:EnhCommentifyPretty='Yes'
    let g:EnhCommentifyRespectIndent='Yes'
    let g:EnhCommentifyUserBindings="Yes"
    let g:EnhCommentifyUseBlockIndent='Yes'

    vmap ,c (Plug)VisualComment
    vmap ,d (Plug)VisualDeComment
    vmap ,g (Plug)VisualTraditional
    vmap ,f (Plug)VisualFirstLine
    nmap ,c (Plug)Comment
    nmap ,d (Plug)DeComment
    nmap ,g (Plug)Traditional
    nmap ,f (Plug)FirstLine
#+END_SRC

(but remember to change "(" to "<" and ")" to ">" -- Wordpress is strict about "<" and ">"...)

Enjoy!
