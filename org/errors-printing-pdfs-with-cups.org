#+TITLE: Errors printing PDFs with CUPS

#+DATE: <2012-09-13>

This is another of those posts /to not forget/. If printing a PDF file with =lp= prints a blank page with error messages like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ERROR: configurationerror OFFENDING COMMAND: setpagedevice STACK: --nostringval-- ...
#+END_QUOTE

the problem is probably that your PDF has a certain page size (let's say /letter/) but your printer expects another (let's say /A4/).

Check your printer settings and your PDf (with =lpinfo pdffile=) to verify. If this is the case, print with this command instead:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lp -o fit-to-page pdffile
#+END_SRC
