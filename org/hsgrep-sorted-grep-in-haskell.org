#+TITLE: HSGrep: Sorted grep in Haskell

#+DATE: <2011-11-27>

As an exercise to learn [[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell][Haskell]], I wrote a specialized =grep= to work on sorted files. It uses [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm][binary search]] to scan a text file and print all the (consecutive) lines that start with a user defined string.

My program is a rewrite of [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/sgrep/][=sgrep=]] in [[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell][Haskell]]: I called it [[https://github.com/lbolla/HSGrep][HSGrep]]. Code is available on [[https://github.com/lbolla/HSGrep][github]].

Thanks a lot for [[http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/6318/8638][all your useful suggestions]]! As soon as possible, I'll post some benchmarking [[./hsgrep-benchmarking][here]]. (EDIT: [[./hsgrep-benchmarking.org][benchmarks now available!]])

After downloading the [[https://github.com/lbolla/HSGrep][source code]], build installÂ and run it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$> cabal build
$> cabal install
$> hsgrep <string> <filename>
#+END_SRC
