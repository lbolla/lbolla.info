#+TITLE: Auto add reviewers in Gerrit

#+DATE: <2012-08-01>

If you are using [[http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/][Gerrit]] for code review and project management of git-based projects, you might find yourself manually adding the same bunch of reviewers to your patches every single time.

In the past, I alleviated the problem with a simple Javascript bookmarklet: add it to your browser and click it while watching the patch in Gerrit.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/1303423.js?file=add_reviewer_bookmarklet.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

But there's a better method: do it from command line, when pushing your local commits to Gerrit. Just add these lines to your =.git/config=:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pushurl = ssh://user@gerrit:29418/project
push = HEAD:refs/for/master
receivepack = git receive-pack --reviewer reviewer1 --reviewer reviewer2
#+END_SRC

Now, when you want to push a review, just do: =git push review= and "reviewer1" and "reviewer2" will be added to your patchset.
