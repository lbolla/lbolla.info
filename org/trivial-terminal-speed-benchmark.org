#+TITLE: Trivial terminal speed benchmark

#+DATE: <2010-04-29>

Today, while playing with [[http://st.suckless.org][st]], I tried a very simple benchmark. Here it is:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
        $> time seq -f 'teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest %g' 999999
#+END_SRC

Here are the results:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
        xterm: 0m28.508s
        rxvt: 0m8.568s
        st: 0m12.082s
#+END_SRC

All the terminals shared the same fonts, but [[http://invisible-island.net/xterm/][xterm]] and [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/rxvt/][rxvt]] had =saveLines=1024= set for scrolling purposes, feature that [[http://st.suckless.org][st]] lacks.

Being [[http://st.suckless.org][st]] at such an early stage of development, I think this is a good result.
