A little story. Older versions are freely available [[http://www.haoli.org/nr/bookc.html][here]]. If you are lazy, like me, and you get bored of saving every single file by hand, you can use [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4336][this fantastic Firefox plugin]]. Or download them zipped [[http://www.adrive.com/public/4fa81bea9d89a52a47f67990fff6b9b98a387f0ce41bda70408768c160bb5846.html][here]].

If you are lazy, like me, and you get bored of having to open a new file for each chapter, you can [[http://www.inkguides.com/merging-extracting-and-converting-postscript-files.asp][merge them in one monolithic file]].

If you are /really/ lazy, like I wish to be, you can use my job and download the complete book in [[http://www.adrive.com/public/b5a8895bec92d042712f668085803d3651e82d5fc1c95c626da59e803c4879c2.html][ps]] or [[http://www.adrive.com/public/6eaf0fd31995c2ade69668c9fcc59331539473ec28845aacbe8a0776888d1986.html][pdf]] straight away.
