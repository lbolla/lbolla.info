#+TITLE: Useful scripts - c+/c-

#+DATE: <2012-11-09>

This is the second post of a series describing simple scripts that I wrote to ease my life as a programmer.

They are [[https://github.com/lbolla/cmd][available on github]]: fork & hack at will!

** c+/c-

In this post I'll describe a very simple script, [[https://github.com/lbolla/cmd/blob/master/c%2B][=c+=]], and its counterpart [[https://github.com/lbolla/cmd/blob/master/c-][=c-=]].

=c+= prepends every line of =stdin= with =#=. =c-= strips =#= from the beginning of each line of =stdin=. I use these scripts to comment/uncomment lines in Python scripts when using [[http://acme.cat-v.org/][=acme=]].

Here is the code:

*** c+

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/usr/bin/env rc

sed 's/^/#/'
#+END_SRC

*** c-

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/usr/bin/env rc

sed 's/^#//'
#+END_SRC
