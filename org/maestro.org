Sometimes people find you.

Sunday, I saw a documentary about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartier-bresson][Henri Cartier-Bresson]]. I must admit I had never heard about him: photography has never been an interest for me. But his photographs were mesmerizing. When, walking in the city center, thinking about decisive moments and how to picture them, I stopped in front of an exhibition. It was about photography. It was about Henri Cartier-Bresson.

From never heard before, to be met twice in a day. Shouldn't we follow coincidences? I like his philosophy: photograph is like an instant painting. The most important thing is the instant: the "decisive moment". Even if he was a reporter, he was convinced that reporting is not art. It's too much about informing. It's for everyone. Art is different, for few should like it. His photos [[http://www.flickr.com/groups/thedecisivemoment-hcb/][inspired many people]].
