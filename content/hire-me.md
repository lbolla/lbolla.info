# Hire me

- template: page.html

----------------

[**I'm available for hire**][1]. I have 10+ years of experience developing software
and I love it!

I am a mature developer, very dependable and precise. Committing to a project,
for me, means understanding its scope and objectives, finding the best tools to
implement it and design it to be extendible and easily testable.

I follow standards religiously, until they slow down development and make
solutions cumbersome: at that point, experience and common sense kick in. I
don't trade maintainability and clearness for conventionality.

My preferred technology stack is:

* [Nginx][6] as load balancer, reverse proxy and static files server
* [Tornado][5] as web server
* [MySQL][9], [SQlite][11] and [MongoDB][12] as databases
* [SQLAlchemy][7] as Object Relational Mapper
* [Bootstrap][8] as front-end framework
* [Backbonejs][10] as client-side MVC

My full CV is available [here][2] and [here][3]; examples of my code can be
found [here][4].

I am open to short (1-3 months), medium (3 months - 1 year) and long (1+ years)
term projects or for consultancy.

[Get in touch with me!][1]
