# Hire me

- template: page.html

----------------

**I'm available for hire**. I have 10+ years of experience developing software
and I love it!

I am a mature developer, very dependable and precise. Committing to a project,
for me, means understanding its scope and objectives, finding the best tools to
implement it and design it to be extendible and easily testable.

I follow standards religiously, until they slow down development and make
solutions cumbersome: at that point, experience and imitation kick in. I don't
trade maintainability and clearness for conventionality.

My full CV is available [here][2] and [here][3]; examples of my code can be
found [here][4].

I am open to short (1-3 months), medium (3 months - 1 year) and long (1+ years)
term projects or for consultation. [Get in touch with me!][1]
