Today, I discovered a new cool feature of blogs: trackbacks!

This is a test, to see if I got it right...

[Here][1] is a clear explanation of trackbacks.

However, you didn't need to include the /trackback/ part of the URL in the post -- it would still have pingbacked without it. The /trackback/ portion is just for the actual trackback field. :) Feel free to pop by and ask any questions if you have any. ~ Teli
