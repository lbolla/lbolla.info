----------------

i decided to switch to ubuntu, at last. and i'm definitely happy for the choice: smooth looking feel, decent speed and big selection of applications. just one "down" point: i spent a whole weekend to install it! not bad, for a distribution said to be "easy on"... after an afternoon reading [here][1], not finding any useful suggestion for my case, i found the solution. for me (and my dell inspiron 5150) the alternate cd worked. so, just forget the install/live cd and go for the alternate: there are no differences, a part from the fact that you'll have to forget the graphical istaller. hth.
