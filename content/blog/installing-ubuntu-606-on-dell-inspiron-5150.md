----------------

I decided to switch to Ubuntu, at last. And I'm definitely happy for the
choice: smooth looking feel, decent speed and big selection of applications.

Just one "down" point: I spent a whole weekend to install it! Not bad, for a
distribution said to be "easy on"... After an afternoon reading [here][1], not
finding any useful suggestion for my case, I found the solution.

For me (and my Dell Inspiron 5150) the alternate cd worked. So, just forget the
install/live cd and go for the alternate: there are no differences, a part from
the fact that you'll have to forget the graphical istaller. hth.
