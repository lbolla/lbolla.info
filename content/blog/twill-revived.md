After reading [how to do automated testing in python][1], I've started using
[twill][2], by [C. Titus Brown][3]

Unfortunately, development on twill seems to have stopped 3 years ago.

I've [cloned the project on Github][4], fixed some deprecation warnings and
added a cool new feature to inspect headers, as well as html.

Testing is more interesting than I thought.
