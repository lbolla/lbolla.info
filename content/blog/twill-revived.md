----------------

after reading [how to do automated testing in python][1], I've started using [twill][2], by [C. Titus Brown][3]

> twill is a simple language that allows users to browse the Web from a command-line interface. With twill, you can navigate through Web sites that use forms, cookies, and most standard Web features.

unfortunately, development on twill seems to have stopped 3 years ago.

I've [cloned the project on Github][4], fixed some deprecation warnings and added a cool new feature to inspect headers, as well as html.

testing is more interesting than I thought.
