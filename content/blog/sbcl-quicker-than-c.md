title: "SBCL quicker than C?"
---

After reading a [nice conversation on comp.lang.lisp][1] I decided to play a
little bit with SBCL and [Debian's Shootout Benchmarks][2].

I considered the [spectral norm benchmark][3] and compared the C and SBCL
implementations.

I started re-running the tests without any further optimization and the results
were similar to the ones reported with C beating SBCL by a factor of 2. (for
the C optimization used, see [here][4]).

Then, I noticed that there was noÂ `(declaim (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0)
(space 0)))` in the SBCL file! I've added it and rerun the test. Here are my
results: 

    N=500
    gcc 0.15u 0.00s 0.17r
    sbcl 0.08u 0.02s 0.21r

    N=3000
    gcc 5.60u 0.00s 5.69r
    sbcl 5.18u 0.01s 5.41r

    N=5500
    gcc 18.81u 0.01s 19.12r
    sbcl 17.42u 0.02s 17.76r

SBCL implementation is actually faster than C! You can find the code for the tests [here][5].
