----------------

the new redesign of [delicious.com][1] broke so many things, that I thought I had to take notes: 

  * [bookmarklet][2] in Chrome can't be drag-n-dropped to the toolbar. its javascript code is also hard to copy and paste to create the bookmarklet "manually".
  * install links for theÂ [chrome][3] and [firefox][4] extensions redirect to [empty pages][5].
  * [documentation for developer][6] is coming soon (!)
  * the [top-right menu][7] with the logged-in username and stuff is the most horrible I've ever seen: it changes its width on hover, the corners look interrupted (in Chrome, at least -- I'm not bothered trying with other browsers)
  * what the hell are [stacks][8]? grouping can be done with tags, already, and I don't want that much space in the page taken by a "social" feature! who needs it?
  * the list of links in the main personal page only shows 8 links on my screen... 8 links?! there's way too much padding, too whitespaces, too much to scroll... it's a bookmarking services, it should show you bookmarks in the most friendly way!
  * image: why should I use an image for myself? and if I don't use one, [I got assigned one by default][9]... please...
I'll add more to the list in the future.
