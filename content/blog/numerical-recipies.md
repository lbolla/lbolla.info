Numerical Recipies is a classic of Scientific Computing. download here the **whole book** in [ps][1] or [pdf][2]. a little story. older versions are freely available [here][3]. if you are lazy, like me, and you get bored of saving every single file by hand, you can use [this fantastic Firefox plugin][4]. or download them zipped [here][5]. if you are lazy, like me, and you get bored of having to open a new file for each chapter, you can [merge them in one monolithic file][6]. if you are _really_ lazy, like I wish to be, you can use my job and download the complete book in [ps][1] or [pdf][2] straight away. enjoy!
