Numerical Recipes is a classic of Scientific Computing.

Download here the **whole book** in [ps][1] or [pdf][2].

A little story. Older versions are freely available [here][3]. If you are lazy,
like me, and you get bored of saving every single file by hand, you can use
[this fantastic Firefox plugin][4]. Or download them zipped [here][5].

If you are lazy, like me, and you get bored of having to open a new file for
each chapter, you can [merge them in one monolithic file][6].

If you are _really_ lazy, like I wish to be, you can use my job and download
the complete book in [ps][1] or [pdf][2] straight away.

Enjoy!
