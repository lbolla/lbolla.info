----------------

I've been using so many code static checkers lately, that I decided to write a
wrapper around the ones I use the most. I called it:Â [Universal Lint][1],
[ulint][1] for short.

At the moment, Python, Javascript and Haskell files are
supported, but adding new linters/extension is trivial.

Download it and use it!
