I'm writing from [here][1], today. Man, a really nice place: it seems to me I'm a student, again! Sleeping on the floor in the dormitory, eating together in the common kitchen, coming to the uni and not attending to the lessons... I'm a bit scared of the "kantine", though. Denmark is not famous for food, is it?

Why "another" in the title? Because the original one is [this][2].
