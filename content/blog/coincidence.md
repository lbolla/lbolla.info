![Coincidence][1] do you trust [coincidences][2]? do you think they exist or do you belong to the [conspiracy party][3]? personally, i think that a coincidence is how we call an event we can hardly explain, because we miss the whole picture. in other words, if we don't know the causes, effects are coincidences. i'm [not the only one][4] to think that, as defined in the common sense (purely random events, weird enough to be noted), coincidences don't exist. [others][5] give [strong arguments][6] supporting this opinion, explaining the law we sometimes miss. i'm not sure the law is correct (is it a coincidence, too?) but, fearing to fall into the deprecable condition in which you are not even sure of existing, i'm sure a law exist. i have to, otherwise i'd better stop thinking: "[cogito ergo sum][7]" or "[sum ergo cogito][8]"? this thinking is not a coincidence, you bet. today is the day after the [political election][9] in my country (italy). i will not discuss about results: trust me, we have discussed enough. today is also the day [bernardo provenzano][10] has been [arrested][11]. he has been fugitive for 42 years: i mean... [42][12]!!! isn't it the number of months the beast will hold possession over the world? or the tao te ching's chapter where universe is explained? or, more simply, [the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything][13]? is it a coincidence? are mafia and politics always incidentally linked? well, i think it's at least _weird_ the choice of the day for his arrest: it must have been longly planned... i'll think about it, will you?
