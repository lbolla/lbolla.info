![Coincidence][1]

Do you trust [coincidences][2]? Do you think they exist or do you belong to the
[conspiracy party][3]?

Personally, I think that a coincidence is how we call an
event we can hardly explain, because we miss the whole picture. In other words,
if we don't know the causes, effects are coincidences. I'm [not the only
one][4] to think that, as defined in the common sense (purely random events,
weird enough to be noted), coincidences don't exist. [Others][5] give [strong
arguments][6] supporting this opinion, explaining the law we sometimes miss.

I'm not sure the law is correct (is it a coincidence, too?) but, fearing to
fall into the deplorable condition in which you are not even sure of existing,
I'm sure a law exist. I have to, otherwise I'd better stop thinking: "[cogito
ergo sum][7]" or "[sum ergo cogito][8]"? This thinking is not a coincidence,
you bet.

Today is the day after the [political election][9] in my country (Italy). I
will not discuss about results: trust me, we have discussed enough.

Today is also the day [Bernardo Provenzano][10] has been [arrested][11]. He has
been fugitive for 42 years: I mean... [42][12]!!! Isn't it the number of months
the beast will hold possession over the world? Or the Tao Te Ching's chapter
where universe is explained? Or, more simply, [the answer to the ultimate
question of life, the universe and everything][13]? Is it a coincidence? Are
mafia and politics always incidentally linked?

Well, I think it's at least _weird_ the choice of the day for his arrest: it
must have been longly planned... I'll think about it, will you?
