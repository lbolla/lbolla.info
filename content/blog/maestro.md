![henry cartier-bresson][1] sometimes people find you. sunday, i saw a documentary about [henri cartier-bresson][2]. i must admit i had never heard about him: photography has never been an interest for me. but his photographs were mesmerizing. when, walking in the city center, thinking about decisive moments and how to picture them, i stopped in front of an exhibition. it was about photography. it was about henri cartier-bresson. from never heard before, to be met twice in a day. shouldn't we follow coincidences? i like his philosophy: photograph is like an instant painting. the most important thing is the instant: the "decisive moment". even if he was a reporter, he was convinced that reporting is not art. it's too much about informing. it's for everyone. art is different, for few should like it. his photos [inspired many people][3].
