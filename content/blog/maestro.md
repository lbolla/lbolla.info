![henry cartier-bresson][1]

Sometimes people find you.

Sunday, I saw a documentary about [Henri
Cartier-Bresson][2]. I must admit I had never heard about him: photography has
never been an interest for me. But his photographs were mesmerizing. When,
walking in the city center, thinking about decisive moments and how to picture
them, I stopped in front of an exhibition. It was about photography. It was
about Henri Cartier-Bresson.

From never heard before, to be met twice in a day.
Shouldn't we follow coincidences? I like his philosophy: photograph is like an
instant painting. The most important thing is the instant: the "decisive
moment". Even if he was a reporter, he was convinced that reporting is not art.
It's too much about informing. It's for everyone. Art is different, for few
should like it. His photos [inspired many people][3].
