a friend of mine sent me [this][1]. it reminded me of my trip in india just 4 months ago... these guys live at an amazing speed... they never sleep! and they don't even need [AIM][2]Â (autonomous intersection management)! the street is the most similar thing to a vein i can imagine. the city is the body. i've always thought that megalopolis are super-human and this confirms my hypothesis. read [this][3] if you like the subject.
