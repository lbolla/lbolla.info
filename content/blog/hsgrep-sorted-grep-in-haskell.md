----------------

As an exercise to learn [Haskell][1], I wrote a specialized `grep` to work on
sorted files. It uses [binary search][2] to scan a text file and print all the
(consecutive) lines that start with a user defined string.

My program is a
rewrite of [`sgrep`][3] in [Haskell][1]: I called it [HSGrep][4]. Code is
available on [github][5].

Thanks a lot for [all your useful suggestions][6]! As
soon as possible, I'll post some benchmarking [here][7]. (EDIT: [benchmarks now
available!][7])

After downloading the [source code][4], build installÂ and run
it with:

    $> cabal build
    $> cabal install
    $> hsgrep <string> <filename>
