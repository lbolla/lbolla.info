----------------

[EMpy][1] is out! Here is the release note: 

> I'm very pleased to announce the release of EMpy (Electromagnetic Python), a
> suite of numerical algorithms widely used in electromagnetism.

> The package, in its very-alpha stage by now, only contains the transfer
> matrix and the rigorous coupled wave analysis algorithms, and some handy
> functions and classes (to model materials, for examples). The idea is to
> expand it in the near future with new algorithms and interfaces to existent
> software.  The package is based on Numpy/Scipy and its homepage:
> [http://empy.sourceforge.net][2].

> Anyone interested in contributing, please contact me:
> [lbolla@users.sourceforge.net][3].
