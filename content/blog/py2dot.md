![py2dot example][1]

`py2dot` is a Python script to generate graphs from aÂ  python program. It
interprets a Python program as a graphs of function calls. It can represent
classes and imported modules.

[py2dot is available from pypi][2]. More information are available [here][3].

## Comments

**[mud_saisem](#53 "2010-12-14 06:38:58"):** it would help if it explains what the following means NameError: global name 'EXCLUDE_CLASSES' is not defined The example on the website does not even work. And there are just about no comments explaining in detail what each class does.

**[lbolla](#54 "2010-12-14 11:48:40"):** the code runs fine in Python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7. I haven't tried Python 3.x. what version of Python are you using? the classes are pretty straightforward and mostly wrappers to easily handler syntax tokens from the Python parser. I suggest you to have a look at the parser standard module.

**[mud_saisem](#55 "2010-12-14 22:56:27"):** Do you have documentation on py2dot ? Using the help(py2dot) tells you about all the classes and methods but there are not comments of documented information explaining what each thing does. How do I know what each class does ? I have managed to get your example to work, and ran it over a script that uses multiple modules that it imports and it contains multiple classes itself. The output of py2dot is simply the name of the script.
