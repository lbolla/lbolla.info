----------------

this is a test blog entry, posted with [charm][1]! [charm][1] is a text-based client which uses the MetaWeblog API to post entries to Wordpress powered blogs. it also implements other APIs. I'm wondering if simple ASCII entries like this one will be properly formatted by the Wordpress' [Intelligent Text Formatting][2] feature. it would be nice to use vim to edit it... enjoy!
