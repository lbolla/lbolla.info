This is a test blog entry, posted with [charm][1]! [charm][1] is a text-based
client which uses the MetaWeblog API to post entries to Wordpress powered
blogs. It also implements other APIs.

I'm wondering if simple ASCII entries like this one will be properly formatted
by the Wordpress' [Intelligent Text Formatting][2] feature. It would be nice to
use `vim` to edit it...

Enjoy!
