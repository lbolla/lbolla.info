Following my [previous post][1], a nice enhancement is using [Markdown][2] to
filter your post before submitting it to [Wordpress][3].

You can either filter it in your preferred editor ([vim][4] uses the `!`
command) or invoke the formatter (for example, `markdown`) from [charm][5]:
command `x`.

Nice!
