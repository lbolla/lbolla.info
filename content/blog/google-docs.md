Cool! Google has launched a new service, called "Google Docs&Spreadsheets":
<http://docs.google.com>. They are merging two different services already
available (Writely and Spreadsheets) into one suite: at the very end, they are
providing free a simplified online Office Suite.

One nice feature is that you
can post your docs on your blog in just few clicks. This post is the witness...

Wouldn't be nice to have just one "editor" on the web that any website can
interface to? Just like Vi in `*nix`? Pretty clever, though.
