cool! Google has launched a new service, called "Google Docs&Spreadsheets": <http://docs.google.com>. they are merging two different services already available (Writely and Spreadsheets) into one suite: at the very end, they are providing free a simplified online Office Suite. one nice feature is that you can post your docs on your blog in just few clicks. this post is the witness... wouldn't be nice to have just one "editor" on the web that any website can interface to? just like Vi in *nix? pretty clever, though.
