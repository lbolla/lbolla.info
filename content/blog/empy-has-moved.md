**[lbolla](#927 "2012-10-15 14:00:34"):** I am glad you like it! EMpy is a one-man effort. I would welcome patches and new contributors, though. Regarding DSL: I am not sure that creating a new DSL would be a big advantage for users. Users can simply build multilayers and new materials using python and the primitives provided by the EMpy library itself. Can you post an example here?

**[Demis John](#926 "2012-10-15 12:13:42"):** Hello, Thanks for maintaining EMpy, I'm finding it really useful! I'm mostly using it for the Multilayer capabilities, although the mode solving is also nice. I was wondering if there are other contributors, such that other capabilities will be added. Fyi, the other package I use a lot is CAMFR - which has a really nice syntax, which enables arbitrary layer/waveguide designs relatively easily. We've coded up other python & matlab tools to have the same syntax as CAMFR. EMpy seems to instead have hard-coded devices - I wonder if it could benefit from an extensible syntax like CAMFR's (even if the underlying methods are different). Just a thought. Either way, thanks for the useful package!
