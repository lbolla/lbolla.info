----------------

Recently, I've been challenged to write a [Sudoku][1] solver. Not knowing the rules and with only 30 minutes, I needed some help... So, in case someone asks me again, I've implemented the same algorithm in Haskell. [gist id=1925630] I know that [there are already a lot of other solutions][2], but, hey, it was fun!
