----------------

Recently, I've been challenged to write a [Sudoku][1] solver. Not knowing the
rules and with only 30 minutes, I needed some help...

So, in case someone asks me again, I've implemented the same algorithm in
Haskell.

I know that [there are already a lot of other solutions][2], but, hey, it was
fun!
