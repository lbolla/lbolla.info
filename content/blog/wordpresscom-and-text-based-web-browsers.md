Today, I was appreciating how well wordpress.com renders on text based web
browsers (using [elinks][1]). Unfortunately, even if reading posts looks great,
posting does not. Actually, I've been able to delete one of my posts, while
searching to edit it. Completely wiped out.

Luckily, [google cache][2] saved my time and promptly found an older copy.
Beware!
