For a non-designer, [Ext JS][1] is kind-of a blessing. It is a self-contained
fully-fledged Javascript framework, with loads of fancy re-usable browser-compatible
professionally-looking widgets. It's only lacking in documentation: finding
your way through the [API documentation][2] is daunting at best.

So, I bought [this][3], and while working my way through it, I decided to share
some experiments. You can find them [here][4]. These are the ones I prefer:
