----------------

This is the first post of a [series][1] describing simple scripts that I wrote to ease my life as a programmer. They are implemented in various languages (`python`, `bash`, `go`) and thought to be used in `Linux`. Some of them are "general purpose", while others are specifically designed to interface other tools I use (for example, `[acme`][2].) All of them tend to have the following properties: 

  * Input from `stdin`, output to `stdout`, errors to `stderr`
  * Return zero on success, non-zero on failure
  * Do one thing only
  * Not too much customizable
These properties allow the scripts to remain very simple, be composable and easy to remember. They are [available on github][3]: fork & hack at will! 

## `a+`/`a-`

In this post I'll describe a very simple script, `[a+`][4], and its counterpart `[a-`][5]. They are the first I wrote when I started using `[acme`][2]. `a+` indents every line of `stdin` by 4 spaces. `a-` "de-indents" it by the same amount. The amount of spaces (4) is fixed (to resist the temptation to change it), and indentation is done with [spaces and not tabs][6]. The code is trivial: it uses `[sed`][7] and `[rc`][8], the [Plan9's shell ported to *nix][9] (although, in this case, any shell would do.) Here it is: 

### `a+`

[code lang="shell"] 

# !/usr/bin/env rc

sed 's/^/ /' [/code] 

### `a-`

[code lang="shell"] 

# !/usr/bin/env rc

sed 's/^ //' [/code]
