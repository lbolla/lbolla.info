![gnod screenshot][1] today, i'll suggest you a new cool link: <http://www.gnod.net/>. from the website: "_Gnod is my experiment in the field of artificial intelligence. Its a self-adapting system, living on this server and 'talking' to everyone who comes along. Gnods intention is to learn about the outer world and to learn 'understanding' its visitors. This enables gnod to share all its wisdom with you in an intuitive and efficient way. You might call it a search-engine to find things you don't know about._" it somehow belongs to the [Web2.0][2] websites, so popular these days. and it reminds me [Pandora][3], which i've [already spoken about][4]. these sites definitely astonish me. they "build" knoledge, or maybe, the "organize" knowledge, already present somewhere else (in the users), but not available to everybody. someone thinks this is the same thing. it's like a huge social experiment, where users contribute to create the "super-user" with an experience equals to the sums of their experiences. the real question about AI is: is it the sum or more?
