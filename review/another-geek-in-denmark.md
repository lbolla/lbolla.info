i'm writing from [here][1], today. man, a really nice place: it seems to me i'm a student, again! sleeping on the floor in the dormitory, eating together in the common kitchen, coming to the uni and not attending to the lessons... i'm a bit scared of the "kantine", though. denmark is not famous for food, is it? why "another" in the title? because the original one is [this one][2].
