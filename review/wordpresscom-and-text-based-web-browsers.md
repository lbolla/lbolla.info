today, I was appreciating how well wordpress.com renders on text based web browsers (using [elinks][1]). unfortunately, even if reading posts looks great, posting does not. actually, I've been able to delete one of my posts, while searching to edit it. completely wiped out. luckily, [google cache][2] saved my time and promptly found an older copy. beware!
