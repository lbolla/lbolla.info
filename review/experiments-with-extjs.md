----------------

For a non-designer, [Ext JS][1] is kind-of a blessing. It is a self-contained fully-fledged JS framework, with loads of fancy re-usable browser-compatible professionally-looking widgets. It's only lacking in documentation: finding your way through the [API documentation][2] is daunting at best. So, I bought [this][3], and while working my way through it, I decided to share some experiments. You can find them here:Â <http://lbolla.github.com/extjs-experiments/> These are the ones I prefer ;-)
