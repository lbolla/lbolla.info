----------------

This fails in py2.4, py2.5.1 and py2.6:
    
    from decimal import Dec_0
    
    

But it works in all the other py2.5 subversions!

It seems that exposing Dec_0 (and other similar constants) was considered a [bug][1] and "fixed" on Jan 3rd 2009 by renaming it `_Dec_0`.

Indeed, if I had looked at the source code, I would have seen that `Dec_0` was for "internal use only".

From `/usr/lib/python2.5/decimal.py:5159`
    
    ##### Useful Constants (internal use only) ################################
    
    # Reusable defaults
    Inf = Decimal('Inf')
    negInf = Decimal('-Inf')
    NaN = Decimal('NaN')
    Dec_0 = Decimal(0)
    Dec_p1 = Decimal(1)
    Dec_n1 = Decimal(-1)
    
    

Those definitions are missing in py2.4 and py2.5.1, and renamed in py2.6.

Damn: never use undocumented features!
