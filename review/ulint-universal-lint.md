----------------

I've been using so many code static checkers lately, that I decided to write a wrapper around the ones I use the most. I called it:Â [Universal Lint][1], [ulint][1] for short. At the moment, Python, Javascript and Haskell files are supported, but adding new linters/extension is trivial. Download it and use it!
